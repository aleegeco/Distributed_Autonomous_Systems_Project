## Questions:
### Task 1
- Can we use the Keras and TensorFlow library to create the neural network?
- The structure of NN is correct ? ![](https://github.com/aleegeco/Distributed_Autonomous_Systems_Project/blob/main/Images/ReteNeurale.jpg)
- Which is the cost function and its derivative ? (MSE - Mean Squared Error)
- The nodes of the graph exchange the the **u** ? (weiths of the NN)
- Do i have to exchange data (**u**) using ROS or i can simulate it on the python terminal ?
- How can I tell that the chart has reached consensus? Should I have a node that calculates the evaluation of NN or look at the difference between the current gradient and the next?

### Task 2
- Check dinamica sisteme per punto 1
- Input parametrico o kronecker Ã¨ ok
- How can we discretize the letters of words with a finite number of robots?
