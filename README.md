# Distributed Autonomous Systems Course Project N°1
This GitHub page contains solutions to [Project N°1](https://github.com/aleegeco/Distributed_Autonomous_Systems_Project/blob/main/Project_1.pdf) of the [Distributed Autonomous Systems course](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2021/454490).

## Task 1: Distributed Classification via Neural Networks
In this task our goal is to compute the backpropagation of a Neural Network to solve a basic classification problem, but in a Distributed framework where more than a NN concur to 
correctly identify the chosen digit.  
First, we have defined a single Neural Networks which is able to solve the task. Then, we moved forward introducing the distributed framework (by using communication graph) and solving it using
the *distributed gradient tracking* to reach consensus among agents.  
The obtained results are visible in the *Images* folder.
